# song_downloader

Song Downloader is simple project of mine that does as it names says, it downloads songs.
All of your songs are downloaded for free from website called https://wwv.mp3juices.icu. This script is based on python and Selenium Webdriver.
I am not associated with this website in any way shape or form I just used it because it was free to download and simple to do.

Put your list of songs in song file and it will download everything and shutdown ads and even stop autoplaying music.


*REQIURMENTS

Selenium Webdriver (you can download it from https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)
Chrome or Chromium (both should work as Selenium is made for Chrome but I used Chromium so I suppose it's the same thing)

*WARNING

This script will not work if you don't change list_of_songs variable and number_of_all_songs variable paths to your own paths to file called songs.
You should also change varible path_to_file to path on which you put your Selnium Webdriver which you downloaded in step before.

___________________________________________________

I'm aware the script throws out those anoying warnings and I will fix it later whis month.
